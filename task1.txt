http/2 is the updated version of http/1.1 which is updated in 2015
http/1.1 loads resources one by one ,if one resource can't load it blocks all other resources
http/2 loads multiple resources at same time with using tcp,if one data can't load it not blocks other data's
http/1.1 can't allow server to "push"content to client
http/2 allows server to push content to client 
http/1.1 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller because smaller data loads quikly than larger one
http/2 also compress HTTP messages but it uses advance compression method called HPACK which eliminate redundant datas
